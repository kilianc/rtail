Stupid simple UNIX style stream broadcast over UDP in your browser.

`rtail` is a command line utility that grabs every line in `stdin` and broadcast it over **UDP**. That's it, nothing fancy, nothing complicated. You can tail your log files, your app logs or whatever you wish to pipe in `rtail` to a `rtail-server` and see multiple streams in the browser, realtime.

## Installation

    $ npm install -g rtail

## Rationale

If you develop software for work and you deploy your code on remote servers using multiple environments, or simply have multiple projects, you know that to monitor realtime your logs **you need to `ssh` to every single machine running your code**.

There are many log aggregation tools out there, and few of them are realtime. **Most of them require you to change your application source code to support their logging protocol/transport**.

This is meant to be a replacement of [logio](https://github.com/NarrativeScience/Log.io/commits/master) which was a cool idea, but not actively maintained anymore, doesn't support node v0.12.* and uses *TCP*, which means strict handshaking between servers and clients other than being resource consuming and very difficult to scale.

**`rtail` approach is very simple:**
* pipe something into it using [UNIX I/O redirection](http://www.westwind.com/reference/os-x/commandline/pipes.html) [[2]](http://www.codecoffee.com/tipsforlinux/articles2/042.html)
* broadcast every line using UDP
* `rtail-server` **if listening** will dispatch the stream into your browser using [socket.io](http://socket.io/).

**There is no persistent layer and it is not meant to persist any data**, `rtail` is a realtime monitoring tool meant to aggregate multiple streams and serve them with a modern web interface, mostly for debugging and realtime monitoring. If you need a persistent layer use something like [loggly](https://www.loggly.com/).

## Examples

In your init script:

    $ node server.js 2>&1 | rtail --id "api.myproject.com"

    $ mycommand | rtail > server.log

    $ node server.js 2>&1 | rtail --mute

Supports JSON lines

    $ while true; do echo [1, 2, 3, "hello"]; sleep 1; done | rtail
    $ echo { "foo": "bar" } | rtail

Using log files

    $ node server.js 2>&1 > log.txt
    $ tailf log.txt | rtail

For fun and debugging

    $ cat ~/myfile.txt | rtail
    $ echo "Server rebooted!" | rtail --id `hostname`

## Params

    $ rtail  -h
    Usage: cmd | rtail --host [string] --port [num] [--mute] [--id [string]]

    Examples:
      server | rtail --host 127.0.0.1 > server.log     broadcast to localhost + file
      server | rtail --port 43567                      custom port
      server | rtail --mute                            only remote
      server | rtail --id api.domain.com               name the log stream


    Options:
      --mute, -m        don't pipe stdin with stdout
      --host            the recipient server host     [default: "127.0.0.1"]
      --port, -p        the recipient server port     [default: 9999]
      --id, --name, -n  the log stream id             [default: uuid()]
      --help, -h        Show help
      --version, -v     Show version number

## `rtail-server(1)`

`rtail-server` catches all messages broadcasted from every `rtail` client and serves a web interface to view the incoming log streams in realtime. **Under the hood uses [socket.io](http://socket.io) to pipe every incoming UDP message to the browser.**

There is tiny to nothing to configure, you can chage the default UDP/HTTP ports, but other than that you're all set.

## Examples

With default values

    $ rtail-server

With custom ports

    $ ratil-server --web-port 8080 --udp-port 9090


Open your browser and start tailing logs!

## Params

    $ rtail-server
    Usage: rtail-server [--udp-host [string] --udp-port [num] --web-host [string] --web-port [num]]

    Examples:
      rtail-server --web-port 8080    custom http port
      rtail-server --udp-port 8080    custom udp port


    Options:
      --udp-host, --uh  the listening udp hostname   [default: "localhost"]
      --udp-port, --up  the listening udp port       [default: 9999]
      --web-host, --wh  the listening http hostname  [default: "localhost"]
      --web-port, --wp  the listening http port      [default: 8888]
      --help, -h        Show help
      --version, -v     Show version number

## UDP Broadcasting

You may want to scale and broadcast on multiple servers, in that case just instruct the `rtail` client to stream to the broadcast address and every message will be delivered to all servers in your subnet.

## Authentication layer

The webapp doesn't have an authentication layer for the time being, it's assumed you run it behind a VPN or a reverse proxy with a simple `Authorization` header check.

# How to contribute

This project follows the awesome [Vincent Driessen](http://nvie.com/about/) [branching model](http://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/).

* You must add a new feature on his own topic branch
* You must contribute to hot-fixing directly into the master branch (and pull-request to it)

This project follows (more or less) the [Felix's Node.js Style Guide](http://nodeguide.com/style.html), your contribution must be consistent with this style.

The test suite is written on top of [visionmedia/mocha](http://visionmedia.github.com/mocha/) and it took hours of hard work. Please use the tests to check if your contribution is breaking some part of the library and add new tests for each new feature.

    $ npm test
